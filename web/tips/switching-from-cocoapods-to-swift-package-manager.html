<h3>Switching from CocoaPods to Swift Package Manager</h3>

<p><em>Tags: Xcode</em></p>

<p>Type: Tool</p>

<p>Tool: Package Manager</p>
<p>My Notenik app makes use of a few third-party libraries. I had originally just downloaded the libraries I needed directly, but then started using CocoaPods. CocoaPods worked great, but then I ran across a library I wanted to try that was not set up for CocoaPods use. After some online checking, it seemed that <a href="https://swift.org/package-manager/">Swift Package Manager</a> was now far enough along that I could use it as a dependency manager for my Mac app. So I decided to rip out CocoaPods and instead try out SPM.</p><p>It turned out to be pretty easy. Here's how I did it.</p><p>Step 1 was to download and run the <a href="https://github.com/CocoaPods/cocoapods-deintegrate">cocoapods-deintegrate plugin</a>. I just followed the instructions provided in the README file.</p><p>Next thing I did was to go over the instructions for manual removal provided in this <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16427421/how-to-remove-cocoapods-from-a-project">StackOverflow discussion</a>. There were a few things left by the deintegrate plugin, so I then threw these in the trash:</p><ul><li>Podfile</li><li>Podfile.lock</li><li>The generated file with the '.xcworkspace' extension.</li></ul><p>Now I just opened my '.xcodeproj' file.</p><p>Then, looking under the Xcode File menu, I found an entry towards the bottom for Swift Packages. I picked 'Add Package Dependency...' from that submenu, and then repeated that step for each of my primary dependencies, filling in the GitHub address for each.</p><p>That was it! Couldn't have been easier!</p>
