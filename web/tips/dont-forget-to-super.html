<h1>Don't Forget to Super</h1>

<p>Tags: Swift</p>

<p>Type: </p>

<p>When overriding a function provided by an API, donâ€™t forget to insert a super call to the API being overridden, unless you are sure you want to completely dispense with whatever functionality is provided by the overridden class.</p>
<p>A failure to add a super call will not be flagged by Xcode, and will often cause problems, if it is done unintentionally or forgetfully.</p>
