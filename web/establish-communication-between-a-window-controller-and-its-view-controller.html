<h1>Establish Communication between a Window Controller and its View Controller</h1>

<p>Tags: AppKit, controller</p>

<p>Type: </p>

<p>Class: NSWindowController</p>
<p>A View Controller doesn’t seem to have any built-in way to communicate with its window controller. </p>
<p>On the other hand, a Window Controller can identify its Content View Controller. </p>

<p>Sample Code: </p>
<pre><code>
guard let vc = customWindowController.contentViewController as? CustomViewController else { return }
vc.window = customWindowController

</code></pre>
