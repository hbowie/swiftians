<h1>File Paths and URLs</h1>

<p>Tags: Foundation, file, path, url</p>

<p>Type: </p>

<p>Class: URL</p>
<p>It’s good to keep in mind that you can actually point to a file or folder programmatically in three distinct ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>A URL</li>
<li>A String containing a file path – typically starting with a forward slash to indicate the system root. </li>
<li>A String representation of a URL pointing to the file location, typically starting with ‘file:///’.</li>
</ol>
<p>(And this is not even counting relative paths or path components!)</p>
<p>See the code snippets for examples of how to convert back and forth between these representations. </p>

<p>Sample Code: </p>
<pre><code>
// Let's start with a URL we got back from NSOpenPanel or something like that
guard let urlOne = openPanel.url else { return }

// Now let's get the path representation
let path = urlOne.path
// path == "/Users/hbowie/Dropbox"

// Now let's get the full URL representation
let urlString = urlOne.absoluteString
// urlString == "file:///Users/hbowie/Dropbox"

let urlTwo = URL(fileURLWithPath: path)
// Now urlTwo == urlOne

let urlThree = URL(urlString)
// Now urlThree == urlOne

let urlFour = URL(path)
// urlFour == nil

</code></pre>
