<h1>Do Things with the File System</h1>

<p>Tags: Foundation</p>

<p>Type: API</p>

<p>Class: NSFileManager</p>
<p>Use NSFileManager for both information about, and operations on, the local file system. </p>
<p>Note that you can typically use the provided singleton, named ‘default’, rather than creating your own.</p>
<p>Note also that many of the NSFileManager methods can throw errors, so you will need to use the [do-try-catch syntax] to provide the appropriate handling in the event of an error. </p>

<pre><code>
do {
	try FileManager.default.removeItem(at: newURL)
	try FileManager.default.copyItem(at: oldURL, to: newURL)
} catch {
	print ("Could not Save current Collection as a new folder")
	return false
}
