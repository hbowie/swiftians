<p>Sample Code: </p>
<pre><code>
// First, establish an outlet for the control
@IBOutlet var searchField: NSSearchField!

// Then request the window to make this control the first responder
// This code would go in the window controller at the appropriate point
guard let confirmedWindow = self.window else { return }
confirmedWindow.makeFirstResponder(searchField)
